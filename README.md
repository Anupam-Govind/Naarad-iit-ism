# Naarada IIT ISM
The Naarada of IIT (ISM), Dhanbad

## What is Naarada?
It is a tool to help the students of IIT (ISM), Dhanbad access information shared to them on different sources at one place. Currently, Naarada collects posts by the ISM administration to the Google groups ug@iitism.ac.in and student@iitism.ac.in. We plan to include other sources like the club notices, fests and (if possible) the institute Management Information System (MIS).

## Tools used to build Naarada
The project is written entirely in Python 3. We have used Python's imaplib to read and parse emails, Facebook's Graph API to post the information collected by Naarada on Facebook and Dropbox's Python SDK to upload attachments to dropbox.

## Contributors
The project has been built by Saurav Chirania and Anupam Govind. We will be happy to have other contributors as well. Please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file too.
